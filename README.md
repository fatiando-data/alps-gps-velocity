# Alps - 3D GPS velocities

This is a compilation of 3D GPS velocities for the Alps.
The horizontal velocities are reference to the Eurasian frame.
All velocity components and even the position have error estimates,
which is very useful and rare to find in a lot of datasets.

## Changes made

> These are the changes made to the original dataset.

* Combined the data from 3 different files, keeping the 3-component
  velocities in the Eurasion frame, coordinates, uncertainties, and station ID.
* Exported to a compressed CSV file.

## About this repository

This is a place to format and prepare the original dataset for use in our
tutorials and documentation.

We include the source code that prepares the datasets for redistribution by
filtering, standardizing, converting coordinates, compressing, etc.
The goal is to make loading the data as easy as possible (e.g., a single call
to `pandas.read_csv` or `xarray.load_dataset`).
Whenever possible, the code also downloads the original data (otherwise the
original data are included in this repository).

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** The easiest way to download this dataset is using
> [Pooch](https://www.fatiando.org/pooch), particularly to download straight
> from the DOI of a release.
